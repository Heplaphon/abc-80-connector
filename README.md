# ABC 80 bildenhet connector
This projects is a loose playground where i dump the stuff i create wile trying to create a connector for the ABC-80  
This project came around because i was offered to borrow an ABC-80 from a friend but without the monitor, since he didn't have it.  
Now, the monitor is kinda crucial to the ABC-80 as both power in and video out goes over the same cable and the cable comes from the monitor. 

## What is the goal
Main goal is just to make it easier to connect some power and video connectors withour having to solder stuff to the ABC-80.
I like keeping old computers free of pcb mods, so if i can create a connector for the original connector it feels like the best option to me.  
I might end up creating some circuitry as well to get more common video and power connectors out, but that is a secondary goal.

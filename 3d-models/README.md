# ABC-80 bildenhet computer side
This is a rough model i made of the connector that is in the abc 80. It is somewhat acurate but all i had was a analog caliper.

## Dimensions
Outer dimensions:
 - Length: ~25.5mm
 - Height: 23mm
 - Depth: 8mm  

Wall thickness: ~1.5mm  

Inner dimensions:  
 - Guide diameter: ~1.5mm
 - Top guides:
   - From inner verical wall to center of guide: ~3.75mm
 - Bottom guide:
   - From vertical wall to center of guide: ~11.25mm

# Spade terminal thickness test
This is some 3d models that i made to 3d print to test the thickness of pcb spade terminals which is one of the ideas I am testing to create the connector.
It's for trying to see if any of the thicknesses would work in the different oincer style pins you find in the ABC-80.  
I have not done connector design before, so the plan is to use a pcb as the base since it is easier to solder the spades to that and to have the spades at a set angle.

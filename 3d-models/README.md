# ABC-80 bildenhet computer side
This is a rough model i made of the connector that is in the abc 80. It is somewhat acurate but all i had was a analog caliper.

# Spade terminal thickness test
This is some 3d models that i made to 3d print to test the thickness of pcb spade terminals which is one of the ideas I am testing to create the connector.
It's for trying to see if any of the thicknesses would work in the different oincer style pins you find in the ABC-80.  
I have not done connector design before, so the plan is to use a pcb as the base since it is easier to solder the spades to that and to have the spades at a set angle.
